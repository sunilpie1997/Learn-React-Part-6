Context

->  WHAT IS NEED OF 'useContext' hook if we already have 'Context' to share data between components??? 

->  context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass

    props down manually at each level

->  One way of doing is --> ex: 'componentX.js'. But as you can see, it's verbose and not readable.

->  useContext hook makes it simpler. It is only used when we need to consume values (replaces <userContext.consumer/>)

->  Ex: ComponentZ.js
