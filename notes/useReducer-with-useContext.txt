useReducer with useContext

->  useReducer - Local state management

->  share state between components - Global state management;

->  USE useReducer + useContext for above

->  for example, we have to implement solution for problem in 'sample.png'.

    Here we have ONLY one counter accessible to all mentioned components.

    we can increment and decrement this counter from these components.


->  ex: ComponentA, ComponentB, ComponentC, ComponentD, ComponentE, ComponentF
